        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Cha-Chai Brews was founded in 2025 by Charmaine Ditlhake, an enthusiastic tea lover and community dreamer who wanted to create more than just a café. Cha-Chai Brews brought the idea of bringing people together, she envisioned a space where conversations could flow as easily as the brews, and where creativity could find a home by offering the community a platform to showcase their talents. This idea started as writing recipes down while sipping a masala chai to growing Cha-Chai Brews through the love of aromatic flavors, culture and art. Every cup tells a story and every artist deserves love.</p>
